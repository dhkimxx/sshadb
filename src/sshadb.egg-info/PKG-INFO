Run Android ADB over SSH on a remote host with a simple Python API.

## Quick Start

```python
from sshadb import SSHAdb

client = SSHAdb(host="192.168.0.10", user="ubuntu", key_path="~/.ssh/id_rsa")
print(client.devices())
print(client.get_state("SERIAL"))
print(client.shell("SERIAL", "echo hello"))
client.push("SERIAL", "./local.txt", "/data/local/tmp/remote.txt")
client.pull("SERIAL", "/data/local/tmp/remote.txt", "./downloaded.txt")
client.close()
```

## Environment variables for tests

- `SSHADB_HOST`, `SSHADB_USER` (required)
